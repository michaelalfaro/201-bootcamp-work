PyRate is a Python program to estimate speciation, extinction, and preservation rates from fossil occurrence data using a Bayesian framework. The method was described here:

Silvestro D., Schnitzler J., Liow L.H., Antonelli A. and Salamin N. (2014) Bayesian Estimation of Speciation and Extinction from Incomplete Fossil Occurrence Data. Systematic Biology, 63, 349-367.

An updated manual is available here: https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/wiki. A PDF manual (no longer updated) and example files can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrate/.

The model with fixed shift times and Cauchy hyper-priors on the birth-death rates is described here:
